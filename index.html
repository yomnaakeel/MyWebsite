		I am currently learning to code with <a href = "https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk"> Code First Girls. </a> Going over everything from how the 
		internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
		Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
		<ol>
		<li>HTML is cool</li>
		<li>CSS is cooler</li>
		<li>JS is the best</li>
		</ol>

<h3> <em> What do you need to create a website? </em> </h3>

	<b> Not much!
<br>
<ul>
	<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
	<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
	<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
	<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li> 
</ul>
